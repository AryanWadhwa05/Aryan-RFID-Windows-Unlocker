# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the RFID sensor with an Arduino Uno. The RFID RC522 requires 7 different connection including a GND and a 3V connection. You can't use a 5V connection as that overheats the sensor and this piece of equipment is genrally very sensitive to extra voltage. We then have a MISO, MOSI, SDA, SCK, and RST connections that all ensure the RFID is able to relay the information to the arduino and that the Uno is able relay the code to the RFID.
