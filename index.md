# Reflection

Throughout my 3 weeks at Bluestamp Engineering, I have learned a great deal in both engineering and coding. I have been taught how to troubleshoot by myself, how to solder sadely, and how electrical components work. At this summer program, I felt more independent since we were informed by the instructors that they would not provide answers to the students questions unless we have tried at least three different ways to try to solve the problem. I think that Bluestamp’s way of teaching is very unique and promotes students to grasp the art of troubleshooting.

I discovered that both the software and Arduino aspects of my project were extremely enjoyable to do. From constantly debugging code to setting up my Arduino uno/micro, Bluestamp Engineering along with the amazing instructors were able to teach me a great deal through my 3 weeks at the program.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the RFID sensor with an Arduino Uno. The RFID RC522 requires 7 different connection including a GND and a 3V connection. You can't use a 5V connection as that overheats the sensor and this piece of equipment is genrally very sensitive to extra voltage. We then have a MISO, MOSI, SDA, SCK, and RST connections that all ensure the RFID is able to relay the information to the arduino and that the Uno is able relay the code to the RFID.
